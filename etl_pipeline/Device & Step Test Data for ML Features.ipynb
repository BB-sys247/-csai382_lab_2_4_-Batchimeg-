    "This table stores raw sensor readings from devices, including device identifiers, timestamps, message origin, sensor type, and recorded distance. It provides granular data on device activity and sensor measurements. These records are essential for building ML features, as they allow us to extract time-based sensor metrics, aggregate device behaviors, and correlate sensor readings with test events.\n",

    "This table contains summaries of rapid step tests, with fields such as start and stop times, test duration, total steps, and an array of step intervals for each test, along with customer and device identifiers. It captures the performance and timing of step tests for each device and customer. This information is crucial for ML feature engineering, enabling us to link sensor activity to specific test windows and compute step timing statistics for predictive modeling."
